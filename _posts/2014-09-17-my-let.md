summary: Implementing the special form as a macro
---

<a href="https://gist.github.com/ifesdjeen/6941906">`my-let`</a>, from [Alex P.](https://twitter.com/ifesdjeen), uses functions to implement a version of the Clojure special form `let`:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defmacro my-let
  [bindings & body]
  (assert (-> bindings count even?) "Bindings count can only be even.")
  `((fn [~@(take-nth 2 bindings)]
      ~@body)
    ~@(take-nth 2 (rest bindings))))
{% endhighlight %}

This isn't a complete implementation of `let`, since it doesn't allow bindings that depend on previous bindings, like in `(let [a 1 b (inc a)] ...)`. And because it's implemented in terms of functions, it also allows the `let` to be a `recur` target (just like `loop`). It's pretty cool how little code it takes to write a feature that can do this:

{% highlight clojure %}
(my-let [{:keys [a b] :or {a :foo}} {:b 2}]
  [a b])
;=> [:foo 2]
{% endhighlight %}

Leaning heavily on pre-existing language features can be a huge help.
