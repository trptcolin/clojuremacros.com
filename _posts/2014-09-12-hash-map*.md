<a href="https://github.com/Chouser/textjure/blob/33637803d5877fb2421e316cbc3e1e975be03524/src/net/n01se/textjure.clj#L26-L29">`hash-map*`</a>, from [Chris Houser](https://twitter.com/chouser), lets you build a Clojure map similarly to the built-in `hash-map`. The value-add here is that you can refer to earlier key-value pairs when building up the map.

{% highlight clojure %}
(defmacro hash-map* [sym & body]
  `(let [~sym {}
         ~@(mapcat (fn [[k v]] [sym `(assoc ~sym ~k ~v)]) (partition 2 body))]
     ~sym))
{% endhighlight %}

This sort of reminds me of `let`, where you can bind new values based on previous ones.
