This blog is to showcase interesting macros around the open-source world. Some will be useful, some complicated, and some just plain silly. The plan is to keep commentary to a minimum and let the code speak for itself.

Hit me up <a href="https://twitter.com/trptcolin">on Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:trptcolin@gmail.com">via email</a> if you have some cool macros you'd like to share with people.

I'm allowing comments, because I think readers of this blog are going to be civil, but I reserve the right to yank them at any time, without warning, because, you know, [Don't Read Comments](https://twitter.com/AvoidComments).
